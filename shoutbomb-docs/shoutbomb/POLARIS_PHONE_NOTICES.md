## SOURCE METADATA

**Source Name:** Polaris Phone Notices Export (Native Polaris Export)

**Source Type:** Polaris Internal Export Process (automated)

**Frequency:** Daily (exact timing controlled by Polaris internal scheduler)

**File Format:** Comma-delimited CSV file with quoted text fields

**File Naming Pattern:** `PhoneNotices.csv` (consistent name)

**Location:** 
- Export destination: Local FTP server (same server that receives Shoutbomb file copies)
- NOT uploaded to Shoutbomb FTP
- Used for validation and supplemental data only

**Purpose:** Polaris' native export format for phone/text notifications intended for third-party notification services. While DCPL uses custom SQL queries for ShoutBomb exports, this file serves as:
- **Validation source** - Confirms custom extraction captured all notifications
- **Supplemental data** - Provides additional fields not included in custom exports
- **Audit trail** - Complete notification lifecycle tracking
- **Gap filling** - Additional details about why, how, to whom, for what, when notifications were sent

**Usage Context:** NOT ACTIVELY USED FOR SENDING NOTIFICATIONS. DCPL's custom SQL extracts (holds.txt, overdue.txt, renew.txt) are what actually get sent to ShoutBomb. This file is imported for cross-validation and enrichment purposes.

**Related Custom Exports:** See `SHOUTBOMB_HOLDS_EXPORT.md`, `SHOUTBOMB_OVERDUE_EXPORT.md`, `SHOUTBOMB_RENEW_EXPORT.md`

- Type 7 is not exportable via standard Polaris export but is handled by custom SQL for renewal reminders

### Polaris.Polaris.NotificationStatuses (For API Confirmations)

**Source:** Polaris API documentation  
**Purpose:** Status codes for use with NotificationUpdatePut API endpoint when confirming deliveries

| NotificationStatusID | Status | Description | Use Case |
|---------------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Call completed - Voice | Successfully spoke with person | Voice delivery to answering person |
| 2 | Call completed - Answering machine | Left message on voicemail | Voice delivery to voicemail |
| 3 | Call not completed - Hang up | Call was hung up | Voice failure |
| 4 | Call not completed - Busy | Line was busy | Voice failure |
| 5 | Call not completed - No answer | No one answered the call | Voice failure |
| 6 | Call not completed - No ring | Phone did not ring | Voice failure |
| 7 | Call failed - No dial tone | No dial tone detected | Voice failure |
| 8 | Call failed - Intercept tones heard | Intercept message detected | Voice failure |
| 9 | Call failed - Probable bad phone number | Invalid phone number | Voice failure |
| 10 | Call failed - Maximum retries exceeded | Too many retry attempts | Voice failure |
| 11 | Call failed - Undetermined error | Unknown error occurred | Voice failure |
| 12 | Email Completed | Email successfully sent | Email delivery success |
| 13 | Email Failed - Invalid address | Email address is invalid | Email failure |
| 14 | Email Failed | Email failed to send | Email failure |
| 15 | Mail Printed | Physical mail notice printed | Print delivery |
| 16 | Sent | Generic sent status | Default success status |

**For ShoutBomb Integration:**
- Use Status 16 (Sent) as default for successful text message deliveries
- Use Status 1 or 2 for voice calls (if ShoutBomb provides delivery detail)
- Use Status 12 for email notifications (if applicable)

**Critical for 3rd Overdue Confirmation Gap:**
This table is essential for the future enhancement to confirm 3rd overdue deliveries back to Polaris via the NotificationUpdatePut API endpoint.

**Note:** Position 16 is PickupBranchID, Position 19 is DeliveryOptionID showing:
- "3" for Voice notifications (DeliveryMethod = "V")
- "8" for Text notifications (DeliveryMethod = "T")

## CROSS-REFERENCE KEYS

**This data source links to other sources via:**

| Field in THIS Source | Links to Source | Field in OTHER Source | Relationship |
|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| PatronBarcode | Polaris Patron Master | Barcode | 1:1 - Identifies patron |
| PatronID | All Polaris tables | PatronID | 1:1 - Internal patron key |
| ItemRecordID | Polaris Item Master | ItemRecordID | 1:1 - Identifies specific item |
| ItemBarcode | Polaris Circulation | Barcode | 1:1 - Item barcode |
| SysHoldRequestID | Polaris Hold Requests | SysHoldRequestID | 1:1 - Identifies hold (0 if not hold) |
| PhoneNumber | ShoutBomb Patron Lists | PhoneVoice1 | Many:1 - Phone lookup |
| NotificationTypeID | NotificationTypes table | NotificationTypeID | Many:1 - Type lookup |

**Key Cross-Validation Opportunities:**

1. **Compare with ShoutBomb Holds Export:**
   - Match by PatronID + ItemRecordID + SysHoldRequestID
   - Verify all holds in custom export appear here
   - Check for holds in PhoneNotices NOT in custom export (missed notifications)

2. **Compare with ShoutBomb Overdue Export:**
   - Match by PatronID + ItemRecordID
   - Filter PhoneNotices where NotificationTypeID IN (1,7,8,11,12,13)
   - Verify all overdues captured

3. **Compare with ShoutBomb Renewal Export:**
   - Match by PatronID + ItemRecordID
   - Filter PhoneNotices where NotificationTypeID = 7 (pre-due)
   - Verify all renewal reminders captured

4. **Compare Patron Lists:**
   - Match PhoneNumber + PatronBarcode combinations
   - Verify DeliveryOptionID matches delivery method (3=voice, 8=text)
   - Detect mismatches in patron delivery preferences

---

## DATA INSIGHTS & PATTERNS

### **Delivery Method Correlation**

**Critical Pattern:**
- Field 1 (DeliveryMethod) and Field 19 (DeliveryOptionID) must correlate:
  - 'V' (Voice) → DeliveryOptionID = 3, 4, or 5 (Phone 1/2/3)
  - 'T' (Text) → DeliveryOptionID = 8 (TXT Messaging)
- If mismatch detected → **DATA INTEGRITY ERROR**
- For DCPL: Only DeliveryOptionID 3 (Phone 1) and 8 (TXT Messaging) are used

### **Notification Type Patterns**

**Field 3 (NoticeType)** - i-tiva compatibility field:
- **Type 1:** All overdues
- **Type 2:** Holds (ready for pickup)
- **Type 3:** Hold Cancel
- **Type 4:** Fines/Bills

**Field 18 (NotificationTypeID)** - Full Polaris notification type:
- **Type 2:** Hold notifications (ready for pickup)
- **Type 7:** Pre-due / Almost overdue / Renewal reminders (not exportable in standard format)
- **Type 1:** 1st Overdue notice
- **Type 12:** 2nd Overdue notice
- **Type 13:** 3rd Overdue notice
- **Type 8:** Fine notices
- **Type 11:** Bill notices
- **Type 18:** 2nd Hold reminder
- **Type 20:** Manual Bill

**Field 4 (NotificationLevel)** - Overdue progression:
- **Level 1:** Default/First notification
- **Level 2:** Second overdue (correlates with NotificationTypeID 12)
- **Level 3:** Third overdue (correlates with NotificationTypeID 13)

### **NotificationLevel and NotificationTypeID Correlation**

The relationship between Field 4 (NotificationLevel) and Field 18 (NotificationTypeID):
- NotificationTypeID = 1 (1st Overdue) → NotificationLevel = 1
- NotificationTypeID = 12 (2nd Overdue) → NotificationLevel = 2
- NotificationTypeID = 13 (3rd Overdue) → NotificationLevel = 3
- All other notification types → NotificationLevel = 1

### **SysHoldRequestID Usage (Field 22)**

- **Positive integers:** First and second hold pickup notices, and hold cancel notices
- **Negative integers:** ILL (Interlibrary Loan) request notices  
- **Value = 0 or NULL:** Notification is overdue, renewal reminder, fine, bill, or other non-hold type

### **ItemRecordID Usage (Field 21)**

- **Present (non-null):** Appears on first and second hold notices, overdues, and bills
- **Null/Absent:** May be null on certain notification types that don't relate to a specific item

### **Conditional Fields (23-25)**

**PickupAreaDescription (Field 23):**
- Only populated on first and second hold pickup notices
- Only when library has configured pickup areas
- Otherwise blank/null

**TxnID (Field 24):**
- Only populated on manual bill notices (NotificationTypeID = 20)
- Database identifier for the patron account transaction
- Otherwise blank/null

**AccountBalance (Field 25):**
- Only populated on fines (Type 8), bills (Type 11), and manual bills (Type 20)
- Decimal value showing patron's current balance owed
- Otherwise blank/null

### **Date Format Difference**

**IMPORTANT:** DueDate (Field 14) uses MM/DD/YYYY format (American format)
- Example: "11/12/2025"
- **Different from ShoutBomb custom exports** which use YYYY-MM-DD (ISO format)
- **Transformation required** when importing to match other date fields
- **Strip time component** from ShoutBomb datetime fields when comparing (HH:MM:SS or HH:MM:SS.mmm milliseconds)

**Field Purpose by Notification Type:**
- **Overdues/Renewals:** DueDate = actual item due date
- **Holds:** DueDate = date held/available (when item became ready for pickup)
- When importing, map this field according to notification purpose

### **Name Field Characteristics**

- **Field 6 (PatronTitle):** Often blank - contains titles like Mr., Mrs., Dr. when populated
- **Fields 7-8 (NameFirst, NameLast):** Case-insensitive
  - May appear in UPPERCASE, Title Case, or lowercase depending on staff data entry
  - Do NOT assume uppercase - normalize as needed for display or matching
- Some names may have unusual formatting (truncated, special characters, etc.)

### **Phone Number Format Variability**

**CRITICAL:** Field 9 (PhoneNumber) may contain various formats:
- **May include:** Dashes, spaces, parentheses, periods, other formatting characters
- **May be:** NULL/blank (not all patrons have phone numbers)
- **Examples of possible formats:**
  - `5551234567` (standard 10 digits)
  - `555-123-4567` (dashed)
  - `(555) 123-4567` (formatted)
  - `555.123.4567` (dotted)
  
**Standardization Required:**
- When comparing to ShoutBomb patron lists (voice_patrons.txt, text_patrons.txt), **must standardize to 10 digits**
- Strip all non-numeric characters before comparison
- Validate 10-digit length after standardization

### **Duplicate Patron Notifications**

- Same patron (PatronBarcode) can appear multiple times in one export
- Reason: Multiple items triggering notifications (multiple holds, multiple overdues)
- Each row = one notification for one item
- Shoutbomb batches these into single notification per patron

---

## VALIDATION RULES

### **Record Count Expectations**

**Daily Volume Estimates:**
- Holds: 50-300 notifications daily (distributed across 4 Shoutbomb exports)
- Overdues: Variable based on circulation (100-500 daily)
- Renewals: 50-200 daily

**Alerts:**
- Zero rows when ShoutBomb exports show notifications → **EXPORT FAILURE**
- Significantly more rows than ShoutBomb exports → **MISSED NOTIFICATIONS**
- Significantly fewer rows than ShoutBomb exports → **FALSE POSITIVES**

### **Data Integrity Checks**

**Required Field Validation:**
- [ ] All PatronBarcode values must exist in Polaris.Polaris.Patrons table
- [ ] All ItemBarcode values must exist in Polaris circulation (when present)
- [ ] All PatronID values must exist in Polaris.Polaris.Patrons table
- [ ] All ItemRecordID values must exist in Polaris.Polaris.CircItemRecords table (when present - nullable)
- [ ] PhoneNumber must be valid format OR null/blank (various formats allowed - standardize for comparison)
- [ ] EmailAddress must be valid email format OR blank
- [ ] DueDate must be valid date in MM/DD/YYYY format
- [ ] DeliveryMethod must be 'V' or 'T' only
- [ ] NoticeType must be 1, 2, 3, or 4
- [ ] NotificationLevel must be 1, 2, or 3
- [ ] NotificationTypeID must be valid Polaris notification type (see lookup table)
- [ ] DeliveryOptionID must be 1-8 (see lookup table)
- [ ] ReportingOrgID must be valid branch (typically 3 for DCPL)
- [ ] LanguageID must be valid Polaris language ID (see lookup table)

**Business Logic Validation:**
- [ ] DeliveryMethod 'V' must have DeliveryOptionID = 3, 4, or 5 (Phone 1/2/3)
- [ ] DeliveryMethod 'T' must have DeliveryOptionID = 8 (TXT Messaging)
- [ ] SysHoldRequestID > 0 implies NotificationTypeID = 2, 3, or 18 (hold-related types)
- [ ] If NotificationTypeID = 2 or 18 (holds), then SysHoldRequestID should be > 0
- [ ] PhoneNumber must match patron record for given PatronID (when present)
- [ ] PatronBarcode must match patron record for given PatronID
- [ ] NotificationLevel should correlate with NotificationTypeID:
  - NotificationTypeID 1 (1st Overdue) → NotificationLevel 1
  - NotificationTypeID 12 (2nd Overdue) → NotificationLevel 2
  - NotificationTypeID 13 (3rd Overdue) → NotificationLevel 3
  - All other types → NotificationLevel 1
- [ ] Conditional fields populated appropriately:
  - PickupAreaDescription only on hold notices (when configured)
  - TxnID only on manual bill notices (Type 20)
  - AccountBalance only on fines/bills (Types 8, 11, 20)

**Cross-System Validation:**
- [ ] Every notification in PhoneNotices should appear in corresponding ShoutBomb export
- [ ] Every notification in ShoutBomb export should appear in PhoneNotices (within date range)
- [ ] DeliveryOptionID in PhoneNotices matches patron's preference in patron lists
- [ ] Phone numbers match between PhoneNotices and voice_patrons or text_patrons lists

### **Import Strategy**

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Import daily file with timestamp
2. Parse DueDate field and convert to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for consistency
3. Cross-reference with ShoutBomb exports from same day
4. Flag discrepancies for review
5. Store as supplemental data in notification tracking table

**DO NOT use this file to trigger actual notifications** - ShoutBomb custom exports serve that purpose.

### **Transformations Needed**

1. **Date Conversion:**
   - Field: DueDate (Field 14)
   - Input: "11/12/2025" (MM/DD/YYYY)
   - Output: "2025-11-12" (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Use for consistency with ShoutBomb date fields

2. **Phone Number Standardization:**
   - Field: PhoneNumber (Field 9)
   - Input: May contain dashes, spaces, parentheses, periods
   - Examples: "555-123-4567", "(555) 123-4567", "555.123.4567"
   - Output: "5551234567" (10 digits only)
   - **CRITICAL:** Strip all non-numeric characters before comparison with ShoutBomb patron lists
   - Validate 10-digit length after standardization

3. **Name Case Normalization (optional):**
   - Fields: NameFirst (Field 7), NameLast (Field 8)
   - Input: May be UPPERCASE, Title Case, or lowercase (depends on staff data entry)
   - Output: Normalize to Title Case for display consistency
   - Keep original for exact matching purposes if needed

4. **Email Cleanup:**
   - Field: EmailAddress (Field 10)
   - Trim whitespace
   - Validate email format
   - Flag invalid emails
   - Flag invalid emails

### **Dependencies**

**Process AFTER:**
- Polaris patron master updates
- Polaris item master updates
- Polaris circulation updates

**Process WITH:**
- ShoutBomb holds export (for cross-validation)
- ShoutBomb overdue export (for cross-validation)
- ShoutBomb renewal export (for cross-validation)
- Voice and text patron lists (for patron preference validation)

### **Key Use Cases**

1. **Validation Dashboard:**
   - Count notifications by type in PhoneNotices
   - Compare counts to ShoutBomb export counts
   - Alert on discrepancies > 5%

2. **Missing Notification Detection:**
   - Identify notifications in PhoneNotices NOT in ShoutBomb exports
   - Root cause: SQL query filters, timing issues, data corruption
   - Trigger investigation

3. **False Positive Detection:**
   - Identify notifications in ShoutBomb exports NOT in PhoneNotices
   - Root cause: Custom query logic errors
   - Trigger SQL query review

4. **Patron Name Enrichment:**
   - Use FirstName/LastName fields to populate patron display names
   - ShoutBomb exports only include patron barcodes
   - Improves notification logging readability

5. **Email Address Capture:**
   - Store email addresses for future multi-channel notification strategy
   - Currently not used for notifications but valuable for reporting

6. **Notification Lifecycle Tracking:**
   - Combine with ShoutBomb delivery reports
   - Track: Queued (PhoneNotices) → Exported (ShoutBomb) → Sent (ShoutBomb report) → Delivered/Failed (ShoutBomb report)

---

## KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS

### **Timing Discrepancies**

**Issue:** Polaris PhoneNotices export timing may not align perfectly with ShoutBomb custom export timing.

**Example:**
- PhoneNotices exports at 6:00am
- ShoutBomb holds export at 8:00am
- Holds that become ready between 6:00am-8:00am appear in ShoutBomb but NOT in PhoneNotices

**Mitigation:**
- Use DateSent field to filter appropriate date range
- Allow for +/- 1 day window when cross-validating
- Focus on pattern detection, not exact row-by-row matching

### **Unknown Fields**

**Field 4 (Unknown_Field):** Always value of '1'
- Purpose unknown
- May be notification queue priority
- May be notification attempt counter
- Requires Polaris documentation or support inquiry

**Field 18 (Unknown_AlwaysTwo):** Always value of '2'
- Purpose unknown
- May relate to notification status
- May be notification generation method indicator
- Requires Polaris documentation or support inquiry

### **Middle Name Field Unused**

- Field 6 (MiddleName) is almost always blank/space
- Polaris patron records may have middle names stored elsewhere
- This export field appears to be reserved but not populated
- Not a data issue, just export design choice

### **No Confirmation Status**

**Critical Limitation:** This file represents notifications **queued/generated** by Polaris, NOT notifications **successfully delivered**.

- Does not indicate if ShoutBomb received the notification
- Does not indicate if patron received voice call or text
- Does not indicate if notification failed
- Must combine with ShoutBomb delivery reports for complete picture

### **No Batch Information**

- File shows individual item notifications
- Does not indicate how ShoutBomb will batch multiple items for same patron
- Cannot determine final message patron will receive from this file alone

---

## ENRICHMENT OPPORTUNITIES

Importing PhoneNotices data into your notification tracking system enables:

### **1. Patron Name Display**
**Current State:** ShoutBomb exports only include PatronBarcode
**Enhancement:** Join with PhoneNotices to display "JOHN SMITH" instead of "23307001234567"
**Tables:** Notification logs, reports, dashboards

### **2. Full Notification Context**
**Current State:** ShoutBomb exports optimized for delivery (minimal fields)
**Enhancement:** Store complete context (patron name, email, dates, IDs)
**Value:** Better audit trail, troubleshooting, reporting

### **3. Email Address Capture**
**Current State:** Email addresses not tracked in ShoutBomb workflow
**Enhancement:** Store for future multi-channel notification strategy
**Value:** Enables future email notification fallback or supplemental notifications

### **4. Validation Metrics**
**Current State:** Unknown if custom SQL captures all notifications
**Enhancement:** Daily comparison reports showing coverage percentage
**Value:** Confidence in notification delivery, early error detection

### **5. Historical Trend Analysis**
**Current State:** Limited ability to analyze notification patterns over time
**Enhancement:** Rich dataset with dates, types, patrons, items for analytics
**Value:** Understand circulation patterns, patron behavior, notification effectiveness

### **6. Pickup Branch Insights**
**Current State:** ShoutBomb exports don't clearly indicate pickup branch
**Enhancement:** PickupBranchID field (position 16) provides branch-level analysis
**Value:** Branch-specific notification statistics and performance

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENT: POLARIS API INTEGRATION

**Long-term Vision:** Replace manual PhoneNotices CSV import with Polaris API integration.

**Potential Benefits:**
- Real-time notification tracking (not just daily exports)
- Ability to mark notifications as confirmed in Polaris
- Solve the "3rd overdue confirmation gap" issue
- Two-way integration: Read notifications AND update status

**Related Project Knowledge:**
- See Polaris API documentation in project files
- PAPIClient Laravel package already created for Polaris API integration
- NotificationUpdatePut endpoint could enable confirmation feedback loop

**Implementation Priority:** Medium-term (after current ShoutBomb validation system stabilized)

---

## SUMMARY

The Polaris Phone Notices export is a **validation and enrichment data source**, not an operational export for sending notifications. Its primary value is:

✅ **Verification** that custom ShoutBomb SQL extracts capture all notifications  
✅ **Supplemental data** (patron names, emails, additional IDs) for richer notification tracking  
✅ **Audit trail** for notification lifecycle analysis  
✅ **Gap detection** to identify missed or erroneous notifications  

By importing and cross-referencing this data with ShoutBomb exports and delivery reports, you gain confidence that patrons are receiving all notifications they should, and can track the complete lifecycle from queue to delivery.
