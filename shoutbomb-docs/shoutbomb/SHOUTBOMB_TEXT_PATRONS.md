## SOURCE METADATA

**Source Name:** Shoutbomb Text/SMS Notification Patrons Mapping

**Source Type:** SQL Query Export (automated via batch script)

**Frequency:** Once daily at 5:00am via Windows Task Scheduler

**File Format:** Pipe-delimited text file

**File Naming Pattern:** 
- Active file: `text_patrons.txt` (overwrites each run)
- Archive file: `text_patrons_submitted_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt`

**Location:** 
- Export path: `C:\shoutbomb\ftp\text_patrons\text_patrons.txt`
- FTP upload: Shoutbomb FTP server at `/text_patrons/text_patrons.txt`
- Archive path: `C:\shoutbomb\logs\text_patrons_submitted_{timestamp}.txt`
- Additional backup: Local FTP server (separate scheduled task)

**Purpose:** Provides Shoutbomb with a daily updated mapping of phone numbers to patron barcodes for patrons who receive TXT Messaging (text/SMS) notifications. Enables Shoutbomb's automated phone service to identify patron accounts when they call in or text. Updated daily to ensure account changes (switching delivery methods) don't create gaps in service.

**Batch Script:** `C:\shoutbomb\shoutbomb.bat text_patrons`

**SQL Script:** `C:\shoutbomb\sql\text_patrons.sql`

**Critical Dependencies:** 
- **MUST run AFTER conflict resolution scripts** (1:30am and 1:45am)
- See "Conflict Resolution System" section below

**Related Documentation:** See `SHOUTBOMB_VOICE_PATRONS.md` for voice notifications equivalent

## KNOWN QUIRKS & ISSUES

**Field Order Variations:**
- [x] Fields are ALWAYS in the same order
- [ ] Field order SOMETIMES varies
- [ ] Field order is UNPREDICTABLE

**Phone Number Format (Field 1 - PhoneVoice1):**
- **Format:** 10-digit numeric, no dashes, no spaces, no extensions
- **Example:** `5559931484` (not `555-993-1484`)
- **Standardization:** SQL removes dashes with `REPLACE(pr.PhoneVoice1,'-','')`
- **Length validation:** SQL filters `LEN(pr.PhoneVoice1) > 9` to ensure 10+ digits
- **US phone numbers only:** No international formats or extensions supported
- **NULL handling:** Patrons with NULL phone numbers excluded from export

**Barcode Format Variations (Field 2 - Barcode):**
- **EXTREME VARIATIONS:** Unlike notification exports, barcodes in patron lists show much wider variety
- **Phone numbers as barcodes:** `5552566367`, `555302970912`, `5556893330` (patron's phone used as barcode)
- **Item barcodes:** `33307006355807` (starts with 33307, normally item prefix)
- **Various prefixes:** `26307015177497` (26307), `9013433930` (no standard prefix)
- **Short codes:** `ETZ`, `B10044981`, `J07655513`, `GA062666236`
- **Long codes:** `J5202403334703`, `L04022800`, `L90088635`
- **Standard format:** `23307006366743` (14-digit starting with 233070)
- **Max length:** 20 characters (nvarchar(20) in database)
- **IMPORTANT:** ALL barcode formats are valid and should NOT be filtered
- **Shoutbomb agnostic:** Shoutbomb accepts any barcode format "within reason"

**Duplicate Phone Numbers (CRITICAL PATTERN):**
- **Same phone can appear MULTIPLE times on this list** with different barcodes
- **Reason:** Family members sharing phone number (parent + child accounts)
- **Shoutbomb behavior:** Maps one phone â†’ many barcodes (one-to-many relationship)
- **Phone number is the key:** Shoutbomb uses phone to identify caller/texter, then presents all linked accounts

**Phone Number Overlap with Voice List (CRITICAL CONSTRAINT):**
- **A phone number can appear multiple times on text list** âœ“
- **A phone number can appear multiple times on voice list** âœ“
- **A phone number CANNOT appear on BOTH lists** âœ— (Shoutbomb requirement)
- **Reason:** Shoutbomb needs phone â†’ delivery method mapping to be unambiguous
- **Conflict resolution:** Automated scripts run at 1:30am and 1:45am to prevent overlap
- **Validation:** Monitor should check for phone overlap between voice and text exports

**Grace Period for Expired Accounts:**
- **Filter:** `pr.Expirationdate > DATEADD(MONTH,-3,GETDATE())`
- **Meaning:** Includes patrons expired within last 3 months (grace period)
- **Reason:** Allows recently expired patrons to continue receiving notifications
- **Active patrons:** Expiration date in future (always included)
- **Recently expired:** Expired 0-90 days ago (included in grace period)
- **Long expired:** Expired 90+ days ago (excluded)

**DeliveryOptionID Exclusivity:**
- **Each patron has exactly ONE DeliveryOptionID** (cannot be 3 AND 8 simultaneously)
- **This export:** DeliveryOptionID = 8 (TXT Messaging / text/SMS notifications)
- **Voice export:** DeliveryOptionID = 3 (Phone1)
- **Result:** A patron barcode appears on exactly ONE list (voice OR text), never both
- **BUT:** A phone number can appear on one list multiple times (family accounts)

**TxtPhoneNumber Field (Internal Polaris Flag - TEXT PATRONS ONLY):**
- **Not exported but CRITICAL for text patrons**
- **Legacy from Polaris SMS:** Boolean flag indicating which phone field (PhoneVoice1, 2, or 3) is text-enabled
- **DCPL standard:** Always uses PhoneVoice1 for both voice and text
- **Text patrons MUST have:** TxtPhoneNumber = 1 (PhoneVoice1 is the designated text number)
- **Voice patrons:** No TxtPhoneNumber requirement (voice works on any phone)
- **Still relevant:** Polaris uses internally even though Shoutbomb handles all SMS
- **Conflict resolution:** resolve_text.sql checks TxtPhoneNumber = 1 when syncing accounts

**Phone1CarrierID (Legacy Field):**
- **Not exported but referenced in conflict resolution scripts**
- **Legacy from Polaris SMS:** When Polaris sent texts via carrier email (5555555555@sms.att.net)
- **Still collected:** DCPL still asks patrons for carrier during registration
- **No longer critical:** Shoutbomb handles SMS directly, doesn't need carrier info
- **Backward compatibility:** Kept for Polaris internal processes
- **Conflict resolution:** resolve_text.sql syncs Phone1CarrierID across family accounts for consistency

---

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION SYSTEM

**Critical Dependency: This export MUST run AFTER conflict resolution scripts**

### **The Problem: Shared Phone Numbers**

**Scenario:**
1. Mother registers with phone `555-123-4567`, selects voice notifications (DeliveryOptionID = 3)
2. Mother appears on voice_patrons list
3. One year later, son registers with same phone `555-123-4567`
4. Staff asks: "Voice, text, or email?"
5. Mother says "text" (unaware she's changing notification method)
6. Staff updates son's account to text (DeliveryOptionID = 8) without checking mother's account
7. **Result:** Same phone on BOTH voice and text lists â†’ **Breaks Shoutbomb**

**Shoutbomb Requirement:**
- Phone number must map to exactly ONE delivery method
- Phone â†’ voice OR phone â†’ text (never both)
- Multiple barcodes can share phone on same list (family accounts)

### **The Solution: Automated Conflict Resolution**

**Schedule:**
1. **1:30am** - `resolve_text.sql` runs (sync voice â†’ text for conflicting phones)
2. **1:45am** - `resolve_voice.sql` runs (sync text â†’ voice for conflicting phones)
3. **4:00am** - `voice_patrons.sql` exports (after conflicts resolved)
4. **5:00am** - `text_patrons.sql` exports (after conflicts resolved)

**Process:**
1. Find accounts updated in last 24 hours with specific DeliveryOptionID
2. Find OTHER accounts sharing same phone number with conflicting DeliveryOptionID
3. Update conflicting accounts to match most recently updated account's DeliveryOptionID
4. For text: Also sync TxtPhoneNumber = 1 and Phone1CarrierID across accounts
5. Log change in PatronCustomDataStrings (field 16) with note: "SB to [voice|text] [date]"
6. Log conflicts to file: `voice_conflicts_{timestamp}.txt` or `text_conflicts_{timestamp}.txt`

**Example Resolution:**
- Mother account: Phone `555-123-4567`, DeliveryOptionID = 3 (voice)
- Son account: Phone `555-123-4567`, DeliveryOptionID = 8 (text), TxtPhoneNumber = 1, updated yesterday
- **resolve_text.sql finds:** Mother's account conflicts with son's recent update
- **Action:** Update mother's account:
  - DeliveryOptionID: 3 â†’ 8 (voice â†’ text)
  - TxtPhoneNumber: NULL â†’ 1
  - Phone1CarrierID: synced to son's carrier
- **Result:** Both mother and son appear on text list only, not voice list
- **Note added:** "SB to text 11-13-2025" in mother's custom data field

**Conflict Resolution Scripts:**
- **Logging:** `C:\shoutbomb\sql\conflicts\log_voice_conflicts.sql`
- **Logging:** `C:\shoutbomb\sql\conflicts\log_text_conflicts.sql`
- **Resolution:** `C:\shoutbomb\sql\conflicts\resolve_voice.sql`
- **Resolution:** `C:\shoutbomb\sql\conflicts\resolve_text.sql`
- **Batch file:** `C:\shoutbomb\shoutbomb_conflicts.bat`

**Critical Notes:**
- **Most recent wins:** Account updated most recently determines delivery method for entire phone number
- **No manual intervention:** System handles automatically every night
- **Family accounts sync:** All family members with shared phone get same delivery method
- **Staff notification:** Custom data field notes help staff understand automatic changes
- **Log files:** Track which accounts were updated and when
- **Text-specific:** TxtPhoneNumber and Phone1CarrierID synced for text patrons

## SQL QUERY

> **File:** `C:\shoutbomb\sql\text_patrons.sql`  
> **Run Time:** Daily at 5:00am via `shoutbomb.bat text_patrons`  
> **Database:** DCPLPRO server, Polaris database

```sql
SET NOCOUNT ON
SELECT REPLACE(pr.Phonevoice1,'-',''), p.Barcode
	FROM polaris.Polaris.PatronRegistration pr
		inner join Polaris.polaris.patrons p
	ON pr.PatronID = p.PatronID
	WHERE pr.DeliveryOptionID = 8
	AND pr.PhoneVoice1 IS NOT NULL
	AND p.Barcode IS NOT NULL
	AND pr.Expirationdate > DATEADD(MONTH,-3,GETDATE())
	AND LEN(pr.PhoneVoice1) > 9
	ORDER BY p.Barcode
```

**Query Dependencies:**
- **Tables:**
  - `Polaris.Polaris.PatronRegistration` - Patron preferences and phone numbers
  - `Polaris.Polaris.Patrons` - Patron master records
- **Views:** None
- **Functions:** 
  - `GETDATE()` - current server date/time
  - `DATEADD()` - date arithmetic for grace period
  - `REPLACE()` - remove dashes from phone numbers
  - `LEN()` - validate phone number length
- **Permissions Required:** SELECT on Polaris.Polaris schemas

**Query Logic:**
- Selects patrons with DeliveryOptionID = 8 (TXT Messaging/text/SMS)
- Removes dashes from phone numbers for standardization
- Excludes patrons with NULL phone or NULL barcode
- Includes active patrons + 3-month grace period for expired accounts
- Validates phone has 10+ digits (after dash removal)
- Orders by barcode for consistent output

**DeliveryOptionID Reference:**
- 3 = Phone1 (voice notifications)
- 8 = TXT Messaging (text/SMS notifications) â† **THIS EXPORT**

**Only Difference from voice_patrons.sql:**
- `WHERE pr.DeliveryOptionID = 8` (text) instead of `= 3` (voice)
- Everything else identical

**Phone Number Standardization:**
- Database stores: `555-993-1484` or `5559931484`
- Export outputs: `5559931484` (dashes removed)
- Length check: `LEN(pr.PhoneVoice1) > 9` ensures 10-digit format

**sqlcmd Execution:**
```batch
sqlcmd -S DCPLPRO -d Polaris -i C:\shoutbomb\sql\text_patrons.sql -o C:\shoutbomb\ftp\text_patrons\text_patrons.txt -h-1 -W -s "|"
```
- `-h-1` - No column headers
- `-W` - Remove trailing spaces
- `-s "|"` - Pipe delimiter

## VALIDATION RULES

**Record Count Expectations:**
- Typical daily volume: 300-1500 text patrons
- Varies based on patron registration and preference patterns
- Generally fewer text patrons than voice (voice is more common)
- Alert if: Drastic change from previous day (possible query/export failure)
- Zero rows: Investigate immediately (unlikely all text patrons disappeared)

**Data Integrity Checks:**
- [ ] All Barcode values must exist in Polaris.Polaris.Patrons table
- [ ] All PhoneVoice1 values must be exactly 10 digits
- [ ] PhoneVoice1 must be numeric only (no letters, dashes, spaces)
- [ ] Barcode must be 20 characters or less
- [ ] Field count must always be exactly 2
- [ ] No NULL values in either field

**Business Logic Validation:**
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** No phone number from this list appears on voice_patrons list (zero overlap)
- [ ] Same phone can appear multiple times with different barcodes (family accounts)
- [ ] Same barcode should NOT appear multiple times (patron has one barcode)
- [ ] Cross-reference barcodes against notification exports to ensure consistency
- [ ] Verify conflict resolution scripts ran successfully (check timestamps)
- [ ] For patrons on this list, TxtPhoneNumber should = 1 in database (not exported but should be set)

**Conflict Detection:**
- Compare PhoneVoice1 values against voice_patrons export
- If ANY phone appears on both lists â†’ **CRITICAL ERROR**
- Alert indicates conflict resolution scripts failed
- Manual intervention required to sync delivery methods

## PROCESSING NOTES

**Import Strategy:**
- New file uploaded daily at 5:00am, overwrites previous
- Archive files are incremental (never deleted automatically)
- Recommended: Import as daily snapshot with timestamp
- Track changes: Compare today's list to yesterday's to detect adds/removes/changes

**Transformations Needed:**
- **Phone already standardized:** 10 digits, no dashes (done in SQL)
- **Normalize barcodes:** Uppercase all barcodes for consistent matching (optional)
- **Deduplicate:** Verify same barcode doesn't appear twice (shouldn't happen)

**Dependencies:**
- **MUST process AFTER conflict resolution** (1:30am, 1:45am scripts)
- Process before notification exports (holds, overdue, renew) for reference
- Compare with voice_patrons export to validate no phone overlap

**FTP Upload Process:**
1. SQL export writes to: `C:\shoutbomb\ftp\text_patrons\text_patrons.txt`
2. WinSCP uploads to: Shoutbomb FTP `/text_patrons/text_patrons.txt`
3. On success: File moved to `C:\shoutbomb\logs\text_patrons_submitted_{timestamp}.txt`
4. Separate task: Copy archived file to local FTP server
5. WinSCP activity logged to: `C:\shoutbomb\logs\text_patrons.log`

**Change Tracking:**
- Compare daily: Today's export vs yesterday's export
- **Additions:** Barcodes in today but not yesterday (new text patrons or switched from voice)
- **Removals:** Barcodes in yesterday but not today (switched to voice/email/mail or expired)
- **Phone changes:** Same barcode, different phone (patron updated contact info)
- **Family accounts:** Multiple barcodes sharing phone (normal pattern)

**Shoutbomb Usage:**
- Shoutbomb stores phone â†’ barcode mappings
- When patron calls automated phone service or texts, Shoutbomb matches phone to account(s)
- If multiple barcodes for one phone, Shoutbomb presents all accounts
- Patron can interact with any linked account during call or via text

## AI/LLM INSTRUCTIONS

> When working with this data source, AI tools MUST:

1. **ALWAYS reference this document** before generating code or making assumptions
2. **Check field count** - exactly 2 fields, pipe-delimited, NO header row
3. **Validate phone format** - exactly 10 digits, numeric only, no dashes
4. **Handle barcode variations** - EXTREME variety including phone numbers as barcodes, item barcodes, short codes
5. **Expect duplicate phones** - Same phone can appear multiple times with different barcodes
6. **Validate no overlap** - CRITICAL: No phone from text list can appear on voice list
7. **Understand conflict resolution** - Must run BEFORE this export (1:30am, 1:45am)
8. **Grace period logic** - Includes patrons expired within last 90 days
9. **Family accounts** - One phone â†’ many barcodes is normal and expected
10. **TxtPhoneNumber flag** - Text patrons should have TxtPhoneNumber = 1 in database (not in export but should be set)
11. **If structure doesn't match** - STOP and alert human

**Critical Reminders:**
- This is the DEFINITIVE source of truth for text patrons export structure
- **MOST CRITICAL:** Phone number overlap between text and voice lists = FAILURE
- Same phone appearing multiple times on THIS list = EXPECTED (family accounts)
- Barcode format is EXTREMELY variable - do NOT assume any pattern
- Do NOT filter barcodes by format - ALL formats are valid (even phone numbers!)
- Conflict resolution MUST complete before this export runs
- Phone number is Shoutbomb's key field (more important than barcode for SMS/phone service)
- DeliveryOptionID = 8 is the ONLY difference from voice_patrons export

**Common AI Mistakes to Avoid:**
1. Treating duplicate phone numbers as errors (they're family accounts)
2. Filtering out "unusual" barcode formats like phone numbers or short codes (all formats are legitimate)
3. Assuming all barcodes follow 233070 pattern (extreme variation exists)
4. Not validating phone overlap with voice_patrons list (CRITICAL check)
5. Adding a header row during import
6. Using comma delimiter instead of pipe
7. Assuming phone has dashes (they're removed in SQL)
8. Not accounting for conflict resolution dependency
9. Filtering out recently expired patrons (90-day grace period)
10. Treating this like notification exports (completely different structure/purpose)
11. Confusing DeliveryOptionID values (3 = voice, 8 = text)

**Validation Example:**
```
text_patrons has:
5556832395|23307000022883
5556832395|23307000068779  â† Same phone, different barcode = VALID (family)

voice_patrons has:
5556832395|23307012345678  â† CRITICAL ERROR: Phone appears on both lists!
```

**Purpose Reminder:**
This is NOT a notification list. This is a phone â†’ barcode mapping for Shoutbomb's automated phone/text service. When a patron calls or texts, Shoutbomb uses their phone number to look up their library account(s).
